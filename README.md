# Classification-of-digital-health-communities-based-on-Deep-Learning

## Introduction:

As part of the graduation project of the Deep Learning course,
We will carry out a research project in the field of health communities.
A database containing various Hebrew texts of health forums will be selected, and we will try to classify the medical community to which the texts belong.

**The classification will by by users and by texts - for 1 from 41 health communities!**

The classification  will be done using different models and we will compare the results:

1.   Random forest based on eigen vectors of the laplacian.
2.   Node2Vec based on random walks inside a LR model.
3.   GCN based on adjacency and feature matrix multiply - inside a LR model.
4.   RNN with pretraind embeddings by word2 vec.
